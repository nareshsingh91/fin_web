            governed by this GT plus certain additional terms and conditions, if

          <h2>General Terms</h2>
          <p>
            If any of these conditions are deemed invalid, void, or for any
            reason unenforceable, the parties agree that the court should
            endeavor to give effect to the parties intentions as reflected in
            the provision, and the unenforceable condition shall be deemed
            severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of
            any remaining condition. Headings are for reference purposes only
            and do not limit the scope or extent of such section. These GT and
            the relationship between the user and Neotec will be governed by the
            laws of the India without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
            Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in relation to
            this Agreement, including a breach or termination thereof, shall be
            settled by a sole arbitrator to be appointed mutually by Neotec and
            the user, in accordance with the provisions of the Arbitration and
            Conciliation Act, 1996, or amendment thereto. In the event we are

            have a panel of three arbitrators appointed, of which one shall be
            appointed by each of us, and the third arbitrator appointed by the

            or quasi-judicial, the same will be subject to the laws of India,
            with the courts in Gurugram having exclusive jurisdiction. The
            failure of Neotec to act with respect to a breach by the user or
            others does not waive its right to act with respect to subsequent or
            similar breaches. This GT constitutes the entire agreement between
            the user and Neotec and governs your use of the Online, superseding
            any prior agreements between the user and Neotec with respect to the
            Online.
