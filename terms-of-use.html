          </p>
          <p>Use of the payment facilities provided by the Online shall not render the Online liable or responsible for

            and conditions of the bank or other financial institution shall also be applicable to every user. The Online
            disclaims any liability arising out of declining of payment by such bank or financial institution.</p>

            right to refuse to process transactions exceeding such limit and transactions by the user that have incurred
            questionable charges and amounts.</p>

          <p>Neotec shall not be held responsible and shall bear no liability in case of failure or delay of delivering
            the products or services including any damage or loss caused to the user due to such delay. No deliveries of
            the products/services shall be made outside the territorial boundaries of India.</p>
          <h2>Liability</h2>
          <p>The user expressly understand and agree that Neotec (including its subsidiaries, affiliates, directors,
            officers, employees, representatives and providers) shall not be liable for any direct, indirect,
            incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to damages for loss of
            profits, opportunity, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses, even if Neotec has been advised of the
            possibility of such damages, resulting from (i) any failure or delay (including without limitation the use
            of or inability to use any component of the Online), or (ii) any use of the Online or content, or (iii) the
            performance or non-performance by us or any provider, even if we have been advised of the possibility of

            equipment or other property as the result of your access to the Online or your downloading of any content
            from the Online.
          <p>
          <p>Notwithstanding the above, if Neotec is found liable for any proven and actual loss or damage which arises
            out of or in any way connected with any of the occurrences described above, then the user agree that the
            liability of Neotec shall be restricted to, in the aggregate, any Specific Service/transactional fees paid
            by the user to Neotec in connection with such transaction(s)/ Specific Services on this Online, if
            applicable. </p>
          <p>Neotec has no control over the third party websites which would be provided to the user through its Online.

            harmless from any and against any claims, causes of action, demands, recoveries, losses, damages, fines,

          <h2>Other Terms and Conditions</h2>
          <p>Neotec reserves the right to make changes to the Online, related policies and agreements, this GT and the
            Privacy Policy at any time as it deems fit and proper, including but not limited to comply with changes in
            law or regulation, correct inaccuracies, omissions, errors or ambiguities, reflect changes in the process
            flow, scope and nature of the Specific Services and extra services, company re-organization, market practice
            or customer requirements. Upon any change, Neotec will notify the updated GT on the Online or other means.
            Your continued use of the Specific Services and extra services constitutes acceptance of the changes and an
            agreement to be bound by GT, as amended. If the user do not agree to the changes, the user may please
            discontinue your use of the Specific Services and ancillary Specific Services. </p>
          <p>Neotec reserves the right to discontinue or suspend, temporarily or permanently, the Specific Services
            including extra services, by giving reasonable time period notice, on a best effort basis, unless it is
            merely to change certain features/contents of the Specific Services and/or Online or maintain the security
            and integrity of the Specific Services. The user agree that Neotec will not be liable to the user in any
            manner whatsoever for any modification or discontinuance of the Specific Services. </p>
          <p>The user agree not to use the Specific Services and extra services for illegal purposes or for the
            transmission of material that is unlawful, harassing, libelous (untrue and damaging to others), invasive of
            another's privacy, abusive, threatening, or obscene, or that infringes the rights of other. </p>
          <p>Neotec may, from time to time, announce certain offers with intent to promote its Online and/or Specific
            Services/ extra services ("<strong>Pr. Off.</strong>"). The Pr. Off.(s) would always be governed by this GT
            plus certain additional terms and conditions, if any prescribed. The said additional terms and conditions,
            if prescribed, would be specific to the corresponding Pr. Off. only and shall prevail over these GT, to the
            extent they may be in conflict with these GT. Neotec reserves the right to withdraw, discontinue, modify,
            extend and suspend the Pr. Off.(s) and the terms governing it, at its sole discretion. </p>

          <h2>General Terms</h2>
          <p>If any of these conditions are deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, the parties agree
            that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties intentions as reflected in the provision, and
            the unenforceable condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability
            of any remaining condition. Headings are for reference purposes only and do not limit the scope or extent of
            such section. These GT and the relationship between the user and Neotec will be governed by the laws of the
            India without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or
            in relation to this Agreement, including a breach or termination thereof, shall be settled by a sole
            arbitrator to be appointed mutually by Neotec and the user, in accordance with the provisions of the
            Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, or amendment thereto. In the event we are unable to reach an
            agreement on the sole arbitrator, we agree to have a panel of three arbitrators appointed, of which one
            shall be appointed by each of us, and the third arbitrator appointed by the two arbitrators. The venue for
            arbitration shall be Gurugram. The arbitral procedure shall be conducted in the English language and any
            award or awards shall be rendered in English. The Online specifically prohibits the user from usage of any
            of its Specific Services in countries or jurisdictions that do not corroborate to all stipulations of these
            GT. The Online is specifically for users in the territory of India. In case of any dispute, either judicial
            or quasi-judicial, the same will be subject to the laws of India, with the courts in Gurugram having
            exclusive jurisdiction. The failure of Neotec to act with respect to a breach by the user or others does not
            waive its right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. This GT constitutes the entire
            agreement between the user and Neotec and governs your use of the Online, superseding any prior agreements
            between the user and Neotec with respect to the Online. </p>
